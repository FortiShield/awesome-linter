Awesome-linter is a ready-to-run collection of linters and code analyzers, to
help validate and fix your source code.

The goal of awesome-linter is to help you establish best practices and consistent
formatting across multiple programming languages, and ensure developers are
adhering to those conventions.

Awesome-linter analyzes source code files using several tools, and reports the
issues that those tools find as console output, and as
[GitHub Actions status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).
